# Building Machine Learning Systems

"Building Machine Learning Systems" is designed to teach you how to train, evaluate, deploy, and monitor machine learning models in production. 

In this repository, you'll find the code to build a fully-fledged, end-to-end machine learning system that you can use as a starting point for your own projects.

This repository is part of the [Machine Learning School](https://www.ml.school) program.

## Running the project on IDX

The simplest way to start is to open the project using Google's Project IDX by clicking the button below. Project IDX will create and configure a development environment you can access directly from your browser:

<a href="https://idx.google.com/new?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsvpino%2Fml.school%2F">
  <img
    height="32"
    alt="Open in IDX"
    src="https://cdn.idx.dev/btn/open_dark_32.svg">
</a>

Using IDX will significantly reduce the time needed to set it up on your local computer. You'll be up and running in a few seconds and won't have to install anything on your environment.

After opening the project, click on the "Machine Learning School" extension on the left activity bar. This extension will allow you to navigate the documentation, run the pipelines, and deploy the model.

*Note:* IDX requires your browser to have third-party cookies enabled. If IDX gets stuck setting up your workspace, go to your browser settings, enable third-party cookies, and restart the browser.

## Running the project locally

If you prefer to run the project on your local environment, you can start by 
[forking](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the [repository](https://github.com/svpino/ml.school) and [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) it on your computer. 

You can run the code on any Unix-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu or macOS). If you are using Windows, install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (WSL).

Open the repository using Visual Studio Code and install the ["Machine Learning School"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tideily.mlschool) extension.

Once installed, this extension will allow you to navigate the documentation, run the pipelines, and deploy the model directly from Visual Studio Code.
