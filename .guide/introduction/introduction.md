# Introduction

"Building Machine Learning Systems" is designed to teach you how to train, evaluate, deploy, and monitor machine learning models in production.

In this repository, you'll find a fully-fledged, end-to-end machine learning system you can use as a starting point for your projects. This template uses the [Penguins dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data) to train a model capable of classifying penguin species.

This guide provides instructions on how to implement each component of the solution and how to deploy and run the system locally and on different cloud platforms.

Here is a high-level architecture diagram showing the main components of the solution:

If you find any issues with the code or have any ideas for improving it, please reach out with your recommendations.
